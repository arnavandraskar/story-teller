# Project Name: Story Generator

This project is a web application that generates stories based on a user-specified topic. It uses the OpenAI API to create a narrative that incorporates elements of character development, setting, and plot to engage and entertain the reader. The generated story is at least 1000 words long and uses descriptive language and vivid imagery to bring the story to life.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.6 or higher.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Set the OpenAI API key in the `app.py` file.
5. Run the application using `python app.py`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. The home page allows you to enter a topic for your story. After submitting the topic, the application generates a story based on the topic using the OpenAI API. The generated story is displayed on the same page.
